## Functioning prototype

### For my personal code, I chose to use Perlin noise to drive the animation. Perlin noise is great for animating various properties of an image. Also I added interactive properties. The user could start or pause the animation by holding(pressing) down the mouse.

### Regarding the animation properties, I was inspired by the black and white screen of old TVs when they lost signal. I felt that Perlin noise was very suitable for such an effect.So I animated the color of the grid cells based on Perlin noise. The opacity of each grid cell, that is, the alpha value, will also be adjusted by Perlin noise, thus creating a dynamic effect.

### Unlike other group members who used audio or interaction to drive animation, my approach was to use Perlin noise to create smooth animations. My animations were based on a grid system where each cell varied independently, creating a complex and evolving pattern. This is how noise was used to achieve effects similar to the loss of signal.

### My inspiration comes from the screen distortion effect after a black and white TV loses its signal. These garbled characters and transparent color blocks will show smooth and continuous changes over time. This effect is very suitable for Perlin noise.
